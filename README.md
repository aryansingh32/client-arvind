# Anand Techno-Fab LLP — Corporate Website

A premium industrial/infrastructure corporate website for Anand Techno-Fab
LLP (Ahmedabad, Gujarat), with a built-in admin panel so every section — text,
images, videos, the logo, contact details, and the arrival animation — can be
edited without touching code or redeploying.

Built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 on the frontend, and
Cloudflare Pages Functions + D1 (database) + R2 (media storage) on the
backend — all on Cloudflare's free tier. All launch content (projects,
certifications, equipment, team, financials, awards, and every page's copy)
is sourced from the company's official Company Profile document; the
original static file, `src/data/company.ts`, is kept as the real-content
reference and as the seed source for the database (see `scripts/generate-seed.mjs`).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # starts the Vite dev server
npm run build      # type-checks and builds to dist/
npm run preview    # serves the production build locally
```

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

This project builds to a static `dist/` folder, which deploys directly to
[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/). Client-side
routing (React Router) is handled by `public/_redirects`, which is copied
into `dist/` on build.

### Option A — Connect the repo in the Cloudflare dashboard (recommended)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages →
   Connect to Git** and select this repository.
2. Framework preset: **Vite**.
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Build output directory: `dist`
5. Save and deploy. Every push to the connected branch redeploys
   automatically; PRs get their own preview URL.

No further configuration is required — `wrangler.toml` and
`public/_redirects` in this repo are already set up for this.

### Option B — Deploy from the command line with Wrangler

```bash
npx wrangler login          # one-time browser auth
npm run deploy               # builds, then runs: wrangler pages deploy dist
```

`wrangler.toml` pins the project name (`anand-techno-fab`) and build output
directory so `wrangler pages deploy` needs no extra flags.

### Option C — Automatic deploys via GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys on every push to `main`
(and can be run manually from the Actions tab). It needs two repository
secrets, set under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — create one in the Cloudflare dashboard under
  **My Profile → API Tokens**, using the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" (or a
  custom Pages: Edit) template.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — found on the right-hand sidebar of any page in
  the Cloudflare dashboard.

Until those secrets are added, the workflow's build step still runs (and
passes); only the deploy step is skipped.

## Admin Panel Setup (one-time, in your Cloudflare account)

The admin panel needs two Cloudflare resources — a D1 database (content) and
an R2 bucket (uploaded images/videos/logo) — plus two secrets. None of this
can be provisioned from this repo alone; run these once, in order, from your
own machine with `npx wrangler login` already done:

```bash
# 1. Create the D1 database, then copy the printed database_id into
#    wrangler.toml (replace REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID).
npx wrangler d1 create anand-techno-fab-content

# 2. Create the R2 bucket for media uploads (name must match wrangler.toml,
#    or edit wrangler.toml's bucket_name to match what you choose here).
npx wrangler r2 bucket create anand-techno-fab-media

# 3. Apply the schema + seed the real launch content (from company.ts +
#    page copy) into the remote database.
npm run db:migrate:remote

# 4. Set the admin login password and the session-signing secret.
#    Pick your own values — these are never committed to the repo.
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
npx wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET
```

Then deploy as usual (`npm run deploy`, or push to the Git-connected branch —
see "Deploying to Cloudflare Pages" above). The admin panel is at `/admin` on
your deployed site; sign in with the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in step 4.

**Local development against the admin panel** (optional — the public site
works fine without this, using the bundled default content):

```bash
# One-time local setup — creates a local SQLite DB under .wrangler/, not
# your real Cloudflare account.
npm run db:migrate:local

# Local secrets, read automatically by `wrangler pages dev` (gitignored):
cat > .dev.vars <<'EOF'
ADMIN_PASSWORD=whatever-you-want-locally
SESSION_SECRET=any-long-random-string
EOF

npm run cf:preview   # builds, then serves the site + admin API on :8788
```

**What's editable from `/admin`:** every page's hero text, headings and
intros; the logo, hero video and hero poster image; the arrival
(logo-intro) animation on/off; the WhatsApp number and default message;
phone numbers, emails and the registered address; the nav menu; the
footer; and every data collection the site is built from — specializations,
projects, the project filters, concurrent commitments, the equipment list,
team headcounts, financials, ISO certifications, statutory registrations,
awards, the completion certificate, and every gallery photo. Editors are
generated generically from the content's shape (text field, textarea for
longer copy, image/video picker, or a repeatable list), so a field added to
the content model shows up in the admin UI automatically — no admin-UI code
changes needed for new fields within an existing section.

**If the admin panel isn't configured yet** (no D1/R2 bound, or the two
secrets aren't set), the public site is unaffected — it falls back to the
bundled default content (`src/data/defaultContent.json`, generated from
`company.ts` + the page copy) and simply doesn't serve `/admin` correctly
until the steps above are done.

## Project structure

  data/defaultContent.json  Generated bundle the site falls back to before/without the DB
  lib/content.tsx         ContentProvider/useContent — reads live content from /api/content
  lib/adminApi.ts          Admin panel's fetch wrapper (auth, content, media)
  components/              Shared UI (Navbar, Footer, Lightbox, ContactDock, ...)
  components/admin/        Generic schema-driven editors (Object/List/MediaPicker), auth guard
  pages/                   One file per public route (Home, About, Services, Projects, ...)
  pages/admin/             Admin login + dashboard
functions/
  api/content.ts           Public: GET the full site content JSON
  api/media/[id].ts        Public: serve an uploaded file by id
  api/admin/               Login/logout/session-check, content writes, media upload/list/delete
  _lib/                    Auth (signed cookie sessions), D1 helpers, shared types

scripts/generate-seed.mjs  Regenerates 0002_seed.sql + defaultContent.json from company.ts
